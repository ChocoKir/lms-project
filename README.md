A College project on Library Management System.

Disclaimer: This project is made for fun entirely with the use of chatgpt.
With some effort to make the chatgpt do exactly what we wanted , we have this as our final product in our last effort.
With the use of AI we got a user friendly approach to make sites with minimal code knowledge.

Moving forward we will make projects with and without Ai.
